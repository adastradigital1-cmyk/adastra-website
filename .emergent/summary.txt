A fully functional, single-page application for the Ad Astra Consultants homepage has been built using a React frontend and FastAPI backend. The frontend implements all the user's specified sections with the requested design, content, and advanced animations. The backend provides API endpoints to securely handle form submissions (Contact, CV, Consultation, Newsletter) and stores the data in the user's Supabase database. The Made with Emergent branding has been successfully removed.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS,  for API calls,  for toast notifications,  for icons.
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic for data validation,  for database interaction.
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) managed by the user.
- **Architecture:** Decoupled full-stack application. The React frontend communicates with the FastAPI backend, which acts as a secure proxy to the Supabase database.

**key DB schema**
- ****: { id, email, created_at }
- ****: { id, name, email, company, message, created_at }
- ****: { id, name, email, phone, job_role, cv_url, created_at }
- ****: { id, name, email, company, job_title, created_at }

**changes in tech stack**
- The architecture was pivoted from a direct frontend-to-Supabase connection to a more secure backend-proxy model to handle the Supabase service key safely.
- The  library was added to the backend dependencies.

**All files of reference**
- : Contains the FastAPI application logic, including the endpoints that forward form data to Supabase.
- : Assembles all the homepage components and manages the state for the modals.
- : Contains global CSS, custom properties, fonts, and keyframe animations for the enhanced UI.
- : Centralizes all API calls from the frontend to the backend.
- : Directory containing all the individual section components of the homepage.
- : SQL script provided to the user to initialize their database schema.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The file  exists but is no longer used for data submission, as this is now handled by the backend. It could be removed to prevent confusion.

**key api endpoints**

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Backend Proxy for Supabase:** Do not attempt to call Supabase directly from the frontend. All data submissions are intentionally routed through the FastAPI backend. This was a deliberate architectural decision to protect the  key and simplify security.
- **User-Managed Database:** The Supabase instance is owned and managed by the user. The required schema is in .
- **Environment Variables:** The application relies on Supabase URL and keys stored in  files in both  and .
- **Animations:** The site features extensive CSS animations defined in . Be mindful of these when making style changes.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **Supabase:** Used for the PostgreSQL database to store all form submissions. The integration uses the user's provided Project URL and API keys.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
- **Test files created:** []
- **Known regressions:** []

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A. The application does not have a user authentication flow. Supabase credentials for the backend are stored in environment variables.

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent has successfully built the homepage as requested. However, the navigation links in the header (Find Talent, Find Jobs, Industries, Insights, About) are currently placeholders (). The implementation of these corresponding pages was not part of the explicit scope for this session but represents the logical next step for the project.</analysis>
