<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a world-class, premium, multi-page website for a global talent solutions firm, Ad Astra Consultants. The initial request was for a homepage, which has since expanded to include an About Us page, a Contact Us page, and a full site structure outlined in a provided document.

The project has undergone several major UI overhauls based on extremely detailed user specifications, evolving into a highly sophisticated and animated global brand experience rather than a simple recruitment site. The design benchmarks are top-tier sites like Stripe, Linear, and Apple.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   **Overall Feel:** A luxury, editorial experience. Described as a global brand experience that happens to operate in recruitment.
-   **Core Design Principles:**
    -   **Glass-morphism:** Frosted glass effects on cards, modals, and the navigation bar.
    -   **Advanced Animation:** Heavy use of  for scroll-triggered reveals, staggered entrances, and parallax effects.  for atmospheric, animated particle backgrounds on all dark sections.
    -   **Bold Typography:** A specific hierarchy using 'Fraunces' (serif) for headlines, 'Outfit' (sans-serif) for body text, and 'IBM Plex Mono' for labels.
    -   **Asymmetric & Rhythmic Layouts:** Alternating between dark () and light () sections to create visual chapters. Whitespace is used generously.
-   **Pages to Build (based on ):**
    -   Homepage (Complete)
    -   About Us (Complete)
    -   Services (Parent Page)
    -   Service Detail Pages
    -   Industries (Parent Page)
    -   Industry Detail Pages
    -   Insights (Blog)
    -   Insight Detail (Article Page)
    -   Careers at Ad Astra
    -   Contact Us (Complete)
-   **Backend:** A FastAPI backend to securely proxy form submissions to the user's Supabase project.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A multi-page React application with a Homepage, About page, and Contact page. The entire site has been built to a very high standard, incorporating a sophisticated design system with CSS variables, custom fonts, glass-morphism, particle backgrounds (), and extensive animations (). The FastAPI backend is functional for handling form submissions to Supabase.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: Building the dedicated  page, which includes a contact form, office locations, and contact details, all styled according to the premium design system. The agent also rewired the primary navigation's Get in Touch button to link to this new page instead of opening a modal.

- **Advanced Animation & Effects Integration:**
    - Integrated  to create animated, interactive particle backgrounds for all dark sections of the website.
    - Integrated  to add sophisticated animations to all pages and components, including parallax scrolling, staggered entrances, and orchestrated hero text reveals.
- **Page Creation:**
    - **About Page:** Built the  page from scratch.
    - **Contact Page:** Built the  page from scratch.
- **Navigation Rework:** Converted the site from a single-page app to a multi-page app using . The main navigation was updated to use  for active styling, and the primary CTA was re-routed from a modal to the  page.
- **Hero Section Rework:** The homepage hero was completely rebuilt to remove the static image and now features a dark, animated background with a word-by-word animated headline.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, , TailwindCSS, .
- **Animation:**  (UI animation),  (background effects),  (number animation).
- **Design System:** A highly bespoke system using CSS variables for colors, Google Fonts for typography (Fraunces, Outfit, IBM Plex Mono), and a glass-morphism aesthetic.
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic, .
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL).
- **Architecture:** Decoupled full-stack application (React SPA -> FastAPI proxy -> Supabase DB).

**key DB schema**
  - ****: { id, email, created_at }
  - ****: { id, name, email, company, message, created_at }
  - ****: { id, name, email, phone, job_role, cv_url, created_at }
  - ****: { id, name, email, company, job_title, created_at }

**changes in tech stack**
- **Added:**  for multi-page routing.
- **Added:**  for all UI and page animations.
- **Added:**  and  for animated particle backgrounds.
- **Added:**  for animated number statistics.

- **Animation Components:** .

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The modal components in  and their corresponding state logic are likely obsolete now that a dedicated  page exists. They should be reviewed and removed if no longer in use.
- The file  is a remnant from an earlier architecture and should be deleted to avoid confusion.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Strict Adherence to Design System:** The user has provided extremely specific and non-negotiable design requirements. ALL new development must strictly follow the established aesthetic. Refer to the user's detailed prompts and the code in  as the ultimate guide.
- **Animation is Mandatory:** The site's premium feel relies heavily on  and . All new sections and components must incorporate these animation libraries for scroll reveals, hover effects, and atmospheric backgrounds.
- **Multi-Page Structure:** The application now uses . New pages must be created in the  directory, added as routes in , and linked from the  component (likely by updating ).
- **Content Source:** Use the content from the user-provided documents (, ) for all new pages.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** The status of the Contact Page is unknown. The last attempt to view it failed, so it may be broken.
- **Mocked:** None

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **Supabase:** Used as the PostgreSQL database for all form submissions, accessed via a secure FastAPI backend proxy. The user provides their own Supabase keys.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES (after the last major UI overhaul).
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
- **Test files created:** []
- **Known regressions:** []

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A. The application does not have user authentication. Form submission testing relies on the environment variables for Supabase being correctly set in the backend.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent has not yet cleaned up the now-redundant modal components (e.g., ) and related state management after creating the dedicated  page.
- The unused legacy file  has not been deleted.</analysis>
