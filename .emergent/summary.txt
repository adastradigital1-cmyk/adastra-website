<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a world-class, premium, multi-page website for a global talent solutions firm, Ad Astra Consultants. The project has evolved from a single homepage to a full-site build with a highly sophisticated and animated design aesthetic, benchmarked against top-tier sites like Stripe and Linear. The goal is to create a global brand experience with a heavy focus on glass-morphism, advanced animations, and a specific typography hierarchy. The project includes a FastAPI backend for secure form submissions.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Pages:** Homepage, About Us, Services/Solutions, Industries, Insights (Blog), Careers, Contact Us, Find Talent, Find Jobs, and their respective detail pages.
- **Design:** A luxury, editorial feel using glass-morphism,  for animations,  for backgrounds, and a strict typography/color system.
- **Backend:** A FastAPI proxy for form submissions to Supabase.
- **Deployment:** The user wants the site deployed and accessible on Vercel.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A sophisticated multi-page React application with a FastAPI backend. The UI is highly styled with a custom design system, implementing glass-morphism, particle backgrounds, and extensive animations.

The following pages have been created with detailed content:
-   HomePage (with a video section)
-   AboutPage
-   ContactPage
-   SolutionsPage (revamped)
-   CareersPage
-   BlogPage (placeholder)
-   ImpactPage (placeholder)
-   FindTalentPage
-   FindJobsPage

The application's data is managed via , which has been populated with content extracted from user-provided documents. However, the live deployment on Vercel is currently broken and failing to build.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was revamping the existing  page with new, comprehensive content provided by the user. The agent overwrote the old page file with the new component structure and content.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? Frontend testing agent (after taking a screenshot to verify the page renders).
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  Issue 1:  (P0) Vercel deployment is failing.
  Issue 2:  (P1) Verify the rendering and functionality of the revamped Solutions Page.
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - **Description:** The Vercel deployment fails with a  error, even after previous errors ( missing, Node version conflicts) were addressed. This is a critical blocker preventing the user from seeing their live website.
     - **Attempted fixes:** The agent has tried multiple fixes with inconsistent results:
        1.  Switching the build command from  to .
        2.  Forcing Node.js versions via ,  (), and . Vercel seems to force Node 24.
        3.  Adding  with .
        4.  Adding  package to resolve a dependency issue.
        5.  The latest attempt involved removing the  path alias from all files and , which initially broke the local preview and had to be corrected. The build is likely still failing on Vercel because of this pathing issue.
     - **Next debug checklist:**
        1. Review the Vercel build logs again to confirm the exact error.
        2. Create a  file that is compatible with  to handle the  alias (e.g., ).
        3. Ensure all imports are updated to be relative to the  directory if aliases are removed (e.g.,  instead of ).
        4. Verify that the build command in  is correct ().
        5. If  is necessary for Tailwind pathing, revert the build command and focus on making  compatible with Node 24, possibly by updating  and its dependencies.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The user cannot view the live version of the website. Fixing this will unblock user verification and deployment.
     - **Status:**  BLOCKED
     - **Is recurring issue?** Y
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (deployment build).
     - **Blocked on other issue:** This is the primary blocker.

  - Issue 2: 
     - **Description:** The agent just overwrote  with new content. It needs to be verified.
     - **Next debug checklist:**
        1. Take a screenshot of the  route to confirm it renders correctly.
        2. Check for any console errors.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To confirm the last user request was completed successfully.
     - **Status:**  NOT STARTED
     - **Is recurring issue?** N
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
     - **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:

**Upcoming Tasks:**
-   **P1: Build Industries Page:** Create a parent page at  that lists all industries served.
-   **P2: Build Insight Detail Page:** Create the template for individual blog/insight articles.
-   **P3: Code Cleanup:** Address the technical debt created during the Vercel debugging.
    -   Clean up and consolidate deployment configuration files (, , , ).

-   Connect all forms (Contact, CV Submission, Consultation) to the backend and test the submission flow e2e.
-   Implement SEO optimizations.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Homepage Video Integration:** Added a new video as a separate section above the hero, with particle animations overlaid. Fixed resulting UI issues with the navbar and mobile view.
- **UI Refinements:**
    - Centered hero section content.
    - Implemented a gradient background for the navbar.
    - Created a seamless blend between the video and hero sections.
    - Applied global CSS for balanced text wrapping to prevent orphan words.
- **Glass-morphism Enhancement:** Greatly improved the glass effect across the site by adding colorful, blurred background blobs behind card elements on light sections, making the effect more prominent as requested.
- **New Page Creation:**
    - Created a full **Find Talent** page () with 8 content sections.
    - Created a full **Find Jobs** page () with 8 content sections.
    - Created placeholder pages for **Solutions, Careers, Blog, and Impact**.
- **Content Integration:**
    - Extracted content from a user-provided PDF.
    - Updated  with new data for awards, services, testimonials, and office locations.
    - Updated the **About Page** and **Contact Page** to use the new dynamic data.
- **Vercel Deployment Debugging:** Attempted to resolve persistent build failures on Vercel related to Node.js version, dependency conflicts, and path aliases.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- The Vercel deployment failure is a major, ongoing issue that the agent has been unable to resolve.
- The task from the previous handoff to verify the  page was never formally closed, though the page was later updated and screenshotted. A dedicated check is still warranted.

- **Obsolete Modals:** The modal components in  are likely unused and should be removed.
- **Legacy Supabase file:**  should be deleted.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **PRIORITY #1: FIX VERCEL DEPLOYMENT.** The user is blocked and cannot see their live site. The issue is complex, involving Node.js version mismatches, dependency conflicts (), and path alias configurations (). The agent's last attempts involved removing aliases, which broke the local preview before being patched. This is where you must start. A stable build process is required before any new features are added.
-   **Design Adherence:** The user is extremely specific about the premium design. All new components must follow the established glass-morphism and animation patterns found in  and existing pages.
-   **Content Source:** All page content comes from user prompts or the central data file at .
